# UnidadSearch ‚Äì Multilingual Immigrant Resource Search Tool

UnidadSearch is a lightweight, multilingual web app designed to help immigrants quickly find trusted legal and procedural resources related to U.S. immigration. The tool is tailored for individuals navigating immigration proceedings ‚Äî especially those without legal representation ‚Äî and is offered freely for public use and nonprofit adaptation.

## üåê What It Does

- ‚úÖ Accepts natural-language questions from users (e.g. *"How do I check my court date?"*)
- ‚úÖ Supports dynamic clarification through simple follow-up questions (e.g. *"Do you have a lawyer?"*)
- ‚úÖ Refines queries based on user context (city, legal status, language)
- ‚úÖ Returns trustworthy links only ‚Äî government (.gov), nonprofit (.org), and community legal support pages
- ‚úÖ Interface is available in: **English, Spanish, French, Arabic, and Chinese**

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

UnidadSearch is built with:

- **Next.js (React)** for the frontend
- A lightweight backend API that queries a search engine using refined terms
- AI-assisted logic that helps determine the user‚Äôs ‚Äúquery intent‚Äù and generates clarifying suggestions (e.g. whether their question involves emergency court issues, work permits, or asylum deadlines)
- **No AI is used to generate the answers** ‚Äî only to guide and refine the search query itself. All search results are sourced directly from external, verifiable websites.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: UnidadSearch does not provide legal advice. It is an informational tool that routes users to public resources.

## ü§ñ Acknowledging AI Use

AI assistance (via OpenAI‚Äôs GPT) was used in:

- Developing the query classification logic
- Generating and translating multilingual UI text
- Structuring the follow-up logic to support non-expert users

We intentionally avoided using AI to generate legal information or responses. All legal content surfaced in results comes from external, publicly trusted sources.

## üì¶ Features Still in Development

- Additional language support (Tagalog, Haitian Creole)
- Offline mode for saved information
- Admin dashboard for nonprofits to track user questions anonymously

## ü§ù Who It's For

UnidadSearch was designed with and for:
- Pro se respondents in immigration proceedings
- Community-based legal aid organizations
- Volunteers, interpreters, and advocates helping individuals navigate immigration

We welcome collaborators and feedback from nonprofit orgs, public defenders, and legal educators.
